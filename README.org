#+TITLE: Physical MPD Models MMT Extension

* About
Provides build targets for physical models formulated in [[https://uniformal.github.io/][MMT]]. 

* Extract model statistics
To load the extension for exporting MMT model theories into python, run in the
 mmt shell:
#+BEGIN_SRC
  extension uniformal.physics.MPDStatsExporter  
#+END_SRC
and then proceed to generate statistics files corresponding to the theories with:
#+BEGIN_SRC
  build MitM/Models mpd-stats
#+END_SRC
Currently, the files will contain functional cycles present in the models. 


* Python
To load the extension for exporting MMT model theories into python, run in the
 mmt shell:
#+BEGIN_SRC
  extension uniformal.physics.PythonExporter  
#+END_SRC
and then proceed to generate python files corresponding to the theories with:
#+BEGIN_SRC
  build MitM/Models mpd-python  
#+END_SRC
